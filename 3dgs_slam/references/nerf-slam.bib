	abstract = {We present Co-{SLAM}, a neural {RGB}-D {SLAM} system based on a hybrid representation, that performs robust camera tracking and high-fidelity surface reconstruction in real time. Co-{SLAM} represents the scene as a multi-resolution hash-grid to exploit its high convergence speed and ability to represent high-frequency local features. In addition, Co-{SLAM} incorporates one-blob encoding, to encourage surface coherence and completion in unobserved areas. This joint parametric-coordinate encoding enables real-time and robust performance by bringing the best of both worlds: fast convergence and surface hole filling. Moreover, our ray sampling strategy allows Co-{SLAM} to perform global bundle adjustment over all keyframes instead of requiring keyframe selection to maintain a small number of active keyframes as competing neural {SLAM} approaches do. Experimental results show that Co-{SLAM} runs at 10-17Hz and achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results, and competitive tracking performance in various datasets and benchmarks ({ScanNet}, {TUM}, Replica, Synthetic {RGBD}).
