## What is this repo for?

Some notes and slides are made when I try to learn everything with the Feynman Technique, i.e., pretend to be a teacher and a student simultaneously. I am willing to share them here. Suggestions for correction or improvement will be gratefully received.

## What is inside this repo?

A series of rigorous but painless introductions of some theoretical stuff for roboticists is currently a work in progress,
- [Probability and Stochastic Process](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/notes/blob/main/stochastic_process/main.pdf)
- [Basics and Variants of Kalman filter](https://github.com/xiaosq2000/notes/blob/main/kalman_filter/main.pdf)
- [Quaternions, Lie Algebra and Topology]
- [FEJ-MSCKF for GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation], attached with C++ implementation and a simulation demo
