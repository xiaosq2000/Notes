    abstract = {In this paper, we introduce \${\textbackslash}textbf\{{GS}-{SLAM

                Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) system. It
                facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy.
                Compared to recent {SLAM} methods employing neural implicit
                representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable
                splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to
                map optimization and {RGB}-D re-rendering. Specifically, we
                propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes
                noisy 3D Gaussian in order to efficiently reconstruct new
                observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously
                observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian
                representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than
                synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the
                pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is
                designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to
                optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust
                estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared
                with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica,

                high-quality reconstruction, accurate pose estimation, and

                built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids,
                leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training
                speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D
                Gaussian Splatting {SLAM} system that reduces the number and the
                parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based
                masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant
                ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry)
                of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which
                motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian

                compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly
                Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either
                opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the
                surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting
                residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color
                rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local
                surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians
                , hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For
                on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for
                three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color
                errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all
                Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable
                Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed {RGBD}
                images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable
                Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable
                Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be
                optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the
                optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time
                reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the

                comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the

                floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances

                Pose estimation is further aggravated since no {GNSS} measures

                in-depth analysis of Gaussian Splatting, we propose several
                techniques to construct a consistent and stable 3D Gaussian field
                suitable for tracking and mapping. Additionally, a novel depth
                uncertainty model is proposed to ensure the selection of valuable
                Gaussian primitives during optimization, thereby improving
                tracking efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on various datasets
                demonstrate that {CG}-{SLAM} achieves superior tracking and
                mapping performance with a notable tracking speed of up to 15 Hz.

                Gaussian representation for high-fidelity spatial representation.
                In this paper, we propose a novel dense representation {SLAM}
                approach with a fusion of Generalized Iterative Closest Point (G-
                {ICP}) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). In contrast to existing
                methods, we utilize a single Gaussian map for both tracking and
                mapping, resulting in mutual benefits. Through the exchange of
                covariances between tracking and mapping processes with scale

                for robotics and augmented reality applications. However, current
                methods are often hampered by the non-volumetric or implicit way
                they represent a scene. This work introduces {SplaTAM}, an
                approach that, for the first time, leverages explicit volumetric
                representations, i.e., 3D Gaussians, to enable high-fidelity
                reconstruction from a single unposed {RGB}-D camera, surpassing
                the capabilities of existing methods. {SplaTAM} employs a simple
                online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying
                Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to
                elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination

                fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determining if

                Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required
                representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and
                high-quality rendering. Designed for challenging monocular
                settings, our approach is seamlessly extendable to {RGB}-D {SLAM}
                when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations
                are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high
                fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original
                3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline
                Structure from Motion ({SfM}) system, we formulate camera
                tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D
                Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking
                with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the
                explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric
                verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities
                occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we
                introduce a full {SLAM} system which not only achieves
                state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory

                Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({VSLAM}) based on Gaussian

                promising results, but rely on {RGB}-D input and is weak in
                tracking. To address these limitations, we uniquely integrates
                advanced sparse visual odometry with a dense Gaussian Splatting
                scene representation for the first time, thereby eliminating the
                dependency on depth maps typical of Gaussian Splatting-based {
                SLAM} systems and enhancing tracking robustness. Here, the sparse
                visual odometry tracks camera poses in {RGB} stream, while
                Gaussian Splatting handles map reconstruction. These components
                are interconnected through a Multi-View Stereo ({MVS}) depth
                estimation network. And we propose a depth smooth loss to reduce
                the negative effect of estimated depth maps. Furthermore, the
                consistency in scale between the sparse visual odometry and the
                dense Gaussian map is preserved by Sparse-Dense Adjustment Ring (

                Recently, there has been a Surge in {NeRF}-based {SLAM}, while
                3DGS-based {SLAM} is sparse. A novel 3DGS-based {SLAM} approach
